      },
      {
        "question": "Why should I practice here instead of paper trading?",
        "answer": "Paper trading shows you the stock name and current news - you already know what happens. Candle Master uses 'blind trading' where you don't know the stock or time period. This forces you to actually learn chart reading, not just remember what happened to Tesla."
      },
      {
        "question": "I'm a complete beginner. Is this for me?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! We built this because we lost thousands as beginners. The Candle Academy teaches patterns from scratch, and you can practice as much as you want without risking a single dollar."
      },
      {
        "question": "What stocks can I practice with?",
        "answer": "500+ legendary stocks with data from 1980-2025. You'll experience Tesla crashes, Apple rallies, Bitcoin volatility, and market crashes. Free users get 10 stocks, PRO unlocks everything."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I play on desktop or tablet?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can play on any device — mobile, tablet, or desktop browser. The game works best on mobile, but the tablet and desktop layout gives you a wider chart view. Just open app.candlemaster.app in your browser."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I cancel PRO?",
